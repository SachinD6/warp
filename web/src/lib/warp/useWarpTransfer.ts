/**
 * React hook orchestrating a Warp transfer: signaling socket, the WebRTC peers,
 * and the symmetric file-transfer tray. Both sender and receiver use this hook —
 * pass `joinCode` to act as the receiver who joins an existing room.
 *
 * Multi-device mesh:
 *   A room can hold several devices (the server allows up to 8). We keep ONE
 *   `WarpPeer` per remote device in a Map, and every device is connected to
 *   every other (full mesh). Each `WarpPeer` is per-remote and already self-
 *   contained — it emits transfer/incoming-offer/file-received/etc. events — so
 *   the hook just FANS OUT (send to all) and STAMPS each event with the peer it
 *   came from (`item.peerId`, `incoming.peerId`).
 *
 * Roles & glare avoidance (see peer.ts): whoever JOINS a room and receives a
 * non-empty `peers` list is the initiator and offers to EACH existing peer. A
 * device already in the room is the responder for each later `peer-joined` and
 * waits for the incoming offer.
 *
 * Review-before-receive: the channels STAY OPEN after a batch. Status reaches
 * "connected" once at least one peer's data channel is open and stays there.
 * Either side can offer files or send text repeatedly. Received files land in
 * `items[]` as in-memory blobs; the UI downloads them on demand. An incoming
 * `offer` is surfaced via `incoming` (tagged with its peerId) until accept/decline.
 *
 * The single-device case is unchanged in behaviour: one peer in the map, fan-out
 * targets exactly that peer, and `incoming`/`accept`/`decline` work as before.

  /**
   * Reload-resume (#36): repopulate the receive registry from the durable ledger so
   * an accidental tab reload doesn't restart a large receive from zero. The sender
   * never gives up — it re-offers unfinished files with the same `resumeToken` — and
   * `handleIncomingOffer` already auto-resumes any inactive registry entry whose
   * key + token match. So reload-survival is just "rebuild the entries from durable
   * storage on mount"; the existing auto-resume path does the rest.
   *
   * Both durable kinds reconcile the ledger offset against what is REALLY staged now
   * and resume at `min(real, ledger)` — never the ledger alone (H1). The ledger's
   * `bytesWritten` was durable when written, but it can outlive the staged bytes:
   * OPFS flushes are BATCHED, so after an unclean close the file's real length can lag
   * the ledger (#169, measured via `opfsDurableLength`); and the IDB staging rows and
   * the ledger row live in separate databases with independent TTL GCs, so a prefix
   * row can be reaped while a fresher ledger row survives (measured via
   * `idbDurableLength`, the contiguous-prefix length). If the durable length can't be
   * read (OPFS file gone / unavailable) we drop the row; if it measures 0 we resume at
   * 0 (an honest full re-receive through the auto-resume path). Memory / disk receives
   * have no row and restart honestly (the sender's re-offer shows the accept modal).
