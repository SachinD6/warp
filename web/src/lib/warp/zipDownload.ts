/**
 * Streaming "download all (.zip)" for received files (issue #28).
 *
 * The old path called fflate's SYNCHRONOUS `zipSync`, which (a) blocked the main
 * thread for the whole archive build — seconds of frozen UI on a phone — and
 * (b) materialized a second full copy of every received blob in memory, so a
 * 1.5 GB batch peaked at ~3 GB and OOM-killed mobile tabs. The engine goes to
 * heroic lengths to avoid buffering (disk streaming, OPFS/IDB staging); zipSync
 * undid it at the last step.
 *
 * This helper streams instead: fflate's `Zip` + `ZipPassThrough` (compression 0 —
 * received files are usually already compressed, so pass-through is right and the
 * CRC is still computed incrementally by the pass-through). Each blob is fed in
 * ~2 MiB slices via `blob.slice().arrayBuffer()`, yielding to the event loop
 * between slices, so the main thread never blocks and peak memory is ~(output so
 * far + one slice) instead of 2× total.
 *
 * True zero-buffer streaming straight to disk needs the service-worker download
 * path (issue #33); until then the archive is still assembled into one final Blob
 * from the collected output chunks. The slice-and-yield structure here is what a
 * `WritableStream` sink would later replace — swap the `chunks` array for a stream
 * and the rest of the pipeline is unchanged.
